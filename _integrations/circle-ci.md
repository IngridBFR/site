You can streamline your workflow by integrating Convox and CircleCI. At a high level, you'll be using familiar CLI commands like `convox build` and `convox deploy`, only from your CircleCI build servers.

## Modifying circle.yml

The [deployment section](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration/#deployment) of `circle.yml` lets you specify commands to run after a successful build. In the example below, a successful build of the `master` branch would trigger a deployment of `example-app` to the `org/staging` Rack.

    staging:
      branch: master
      commands:
        - convox deploy --app example-app --rack org/staging

## Authentication

You'll also need to enable the CircleCI build server to authenticate with your Rack before it can run commands like `convox build` or `convox deploy`. When using the CLI from your development machine, you'd typically `convox login` to do so, but when using CircleCI, you'll want to set `CONVOX_HOST` and `CONVOX_PASSWORD` instead. To set environment variables in CircleCI, follow their instructions for [keeping your environment variable secrets out of version control](https://circleci.com/docs/environment-variables/#setting-environment-variables-for-all-commands-without-adding-them-to-git).

### Authenticating with Console deploy keys

If you use [Console](https://{{ site.console_host }}/) to manage access to your Racks, you'll need to set the following environment variables in CircleCI:

    CONVOX_HOST={{ site.console_host }}
    CONVOX_PASSWORD=<deploy key>

For more information, see [deploy keys](/docs/deploy-keys).
